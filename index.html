    <h1>🖥️ Windows 11 is Here – Is Your Clinic Ready?</h1>
    <p><strong>Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025.</strong><br>
    That means now is the time to start planning your upgrade to Windows 11 — before it becomes urgent.</p>

    <h2>✅ How to Check if Your Device is Compatible</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Download the PC Health Check Tool</strong><br>
        Get it directly from Microsoft: <a href="https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp</a></li>
      <li><strong>Run the tool</strong><br>
        It will tell you if your device meets the system requirements for Windows 11.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>⚕️ Why Doctors Should Consider Upgrading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Faster & More Reliable</strong> – Optimized performance on newer hardware.</li>
      <li><strong>Modern Security</strong> – Better protection for sensitive patient data.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Multitasking</strong> – Snap layouts and virtual desktops for easier charting and EMRs.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Compatibility</strong> – Stay ahead as medical software evolves.</li>
      <li><strong>Peace of Mind</strong> – Avoid last-minute stress and ensure smooth transitions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛠️ What if My Computer Isn’t Compatible?</h2>
    <p>You’re not alone. Many clinics we support have already gone through this.</p>
    <p>We recently helped three clinics replace their incompatible systems with fully set-up Windows 11 workstations. The transition was seamless — our team handled everything from ordering to setup, so the doctors could focus on their patients, not their tech.</p>
    <p class="quote">“We were dreading the upgrade process, but your team made it painless.” — Clinic Manager, Ottawa</p>

      <strong>💡 Pro Tip: Don’t wait until October 2025</strong><br>
      Upgrading now gives you time to plan, test, and avoid disruption — especially in busy clinics. Plus, early action gives you more options (and better pricing) when it comes to hardware and support.
